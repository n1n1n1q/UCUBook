### Intro
<br>*UCUBook* is a service for a more convenient experience of room reservations within the UCU ecosystem.
#### Our main goal was to fix the issues of the current booking system:
1) Incenvenient user interface
2) Long waiting time for feedback (or lack of feedback)
3) Lack of efficiency and organization
4) The need to use three different services for booking
## Why UCUBook? 
In the proccess of development of the web-app, we attempted to fix these flaws of the current reservations systme and improve other aspects in order to enhance the user's experience.
1) All interections take place within one service
2) Timely feedback
3) Specialized pages for the user and the person in charge of reservation approvals
4) A more user-user friendly interface and a more pleasant experience on mobile 
5) Interactive map (available for desktop users) for a better understanding of the rooms' locations
## How to use UCUBook?

### Main page
After logging into the service for the first time using your UCU email, your UCUBook account is created automatically. From now on, you can continue on using Google login and your UCU email but, aside from that, your password, randomly generated specifically for your account, will be emailed to you. 

<br>After logging in successfully, you will be redirected to the main page of the web app.

### Booking
All reservations can be made on the main page. In order to book a room on desktop, press on the room on the map or enter the room number into the search box.

After you have chosen the room, a menu will appear, where you need to enter the date of your reservation.

To the right, the status of your request is displayed.

### Admin interface
Users that have administrator rights have access to approving and declining reservation requests and the history of already processed requests.

A filter can be applied to the reservation history, that will sort the requests by room or date. Every request has a description, time, date and login of the user, who sent the request. Apart from processing requests, the admin interface has the same functionality as the user's interface, meaning they can also send requests and review their own reservation history separately.
